# tcnj-plug
=========

### Abstract
Clubs often have shared interests but weak ties.  Wouldn't it be great if the very tool that manages your club was also a portal to plug other organization interested in your message?  Introducing tcnj.plug.net.  Part club network, part management portal, Plug looks to streamline the process of getting the word out to other organizations in a streamlined manner.

Stretch - Individuals can publicize what they're good at.  If you need art or something organized, your on-campus resources are reaching out to you!  Keep a reddit-style feed of requests and email them to everyone on the tag!

Style - Interface should feel like Netflix and Rdio smooshed together, with YOUR events instead of random movies.

_Note: Plugging another club's announcement should be easy and pretty!  Big candy-bar style buttons, click when you've plugged it, get points, send notifications to other club that they plugged your event._

_Note: Auto-detect membership should analyze the topics a person is interested in, the clubs their in, and detect their availability._

_Note: Show plugs in order of New, Upcoming, Old (reoccurring)._
