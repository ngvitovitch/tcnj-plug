# tcnj-plug
=========

### Abstract
Clubs often have shared interests but weak ties.  Wouldn't it be great if the very tool that manages your club was also a portal to plug other organization interested in your message?  Introducing tcnj.plug.net.  Part club network, part management portal, Plug looks to streamline the process of getting the word out to other organizations in a streamlined manner.

### Club Functions
I would like to implement the following features from the perspective of the club

##### Membership
- [ ] View current membership
- [ ] View alumni membership
- [ ] Edit membership details
- [ ] Send membership invitation
- [ ] Remove membership
- [ ] Automatically detect graduates
- [ ] Automatically detect potential club members

##### Eboard
- [ ] View current eboard
- [ ] View eboard history
- [ ] Configure eboard mailing list
- [ ] Send an eboard message

##### Networking
- [ ] Make an announcement (plug something...)
- [ ] Plug another club's announcement

### Personal Functions

### Automated Functions
- [ ] Automatically log all searches, tags, etc.
- [ ] Send weekly notification with relevant events, clubs, new clubs.

_Note: Plugging another club's announcement should be easy and pretty!  Big candy-bar style buttons, click when you've plugged it, get points, send notifications to other club that they plugged your event._

_Note: Auto-detect membership should analyze the topics a person is interested in, the clubs their in, and detect their availability._
